Knows Bugs : 

Select plugin : -> graphical bug with packet description label when description too long.

Configsource plugin : -> No feedback during the download when using file:/// as a custom mirror

TODO for 0.3:

Partdisk plugin : -> add raid support

General : -> Verify C code, remove useless parts, simplify code if possible !
	  -> Need a local version working with gtk+-directfb library

Plugins : -> Cut some plugins into 2 for make it more simpler for newbies

Ideas :

-> Improve gui (dialogbox for exemple)
-> Improve help (add tooltip text, etc...)

Compiling and testing : Just do a 'make' in source directory then do './fwife' :p

Any suggestions or patchs are welcome ;)
