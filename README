						Fwife : Frugalware Installer Frontend Readme

Fwife 0.1 beta

Warning : Beta version - Caution - Many bugs, segfaults and memory leaks are possible. Use for testing only.

This version only support netinstall because it's necessary for fwlive. I will see after for a local version.

Knows Bugs : 

Select plugin : -> graphical bug with packet description label when description too long.

General : -> Some stock icons are not loaded in configuration part when gtk is not installed on target (due to chroot()).

TODO :

Partdisk plugin : -> add raid support

General : -> Verify C code, remove useless parts, simplify code if possible !

Ideas :

-> Made new configuration plugin for selecting default desktop manager (xdm, gdm, kdm) and default window manager
-> Improve gui (dialogbox for exemple)
-> Improve help (add tooltip text, etc...)

Text (dialogbox, labels, help widget) need to be write/rewrite with a good english :p

Compiling and testing : Just do a 'make' in source directory then do './fwife' :p

Any suggestions or patchs are welcome ;)
