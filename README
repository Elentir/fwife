						Fwife : Frugalware Installer Frontend Readme

Fwife 0.1 alpha

Warning : Alpha version - Core works but plugins aren't finished. Many bugs, segfaults and memory leaks are possible.

This version of Fwife do not included the ncurse version of frugalware installer. A common version is possible to do because many parts of the code is re-used. This version only support netinstall because it's necessary for fwlive. I will see after for a local version. Any suggestion and patchs are welcome.
